<H2><A name=i>Introduction</A></H2><I>Why qmail?</I> 
<P>Why switch to qmail? If you've ever edited a sendmail.cf file, you know why. 
But there are other reasons to switch. Here are some of the more common 
reasons:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Security. qmail is secure. This claim was backed up by a <A 
  href="http://web.infoave.net/~dsill/qmail.html">$1000 prize</A> offered by 
  qmail supporters. After a year, the prize money was not claimed, and was sent 
  to the <A href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</A>. <A 
  href="http://cr.yp.to/djb.html">Dan Bernstein</A>, the author of qmail, is 
  also currently offering a <A href="http://cr.yp.to/qmail/guarantee.html">$500 
  prize</A> for anyone who can find a security hole in qmail. 
  <LI>Speed. qmail is capable of handling millions of deliveries per day on a 
  moderate system. Even a 486 can handle mail volumes of 100,000 messages per 
  day and many simultaneous deliveries. <BR>
  <LI>Reliability. qmail writes mail to disk before it announces success. This 
  way, even if there is a loss of power in the middle of a disk write, qmail 
  will not lose mail. 
  <LI>Extremely easy virtual domain administration. There is even an add-on for 
  qmail called <A href="http://www.inter7.com/vpopmail/">vchkpw</A> which 
  supports Virtual POP domains. Using this package, it is possible to set up 
  POP3 users who do not even have UNIX accounts on the system. 
  <LI>User-controlled mailing lists using <A 
  href="http://www.ezmlm.org/">ezmlm.</A> 
  <LI>More intuitive, straightforward, and simpler administration. </LI></UL>
<P>Now when I say qmail is easier than sendmail, you must believe me, although 
you won't for the first few hours. qmail documentation, despite being well 
written and very complete, can sometimes be very esoteric, Most of it is not 
step-by-step instructions like a howto. Like any good software, if you want to 
get the most out of qmail, you will have to understand the theories behind how 
it works, and why it does things the way it does them. (for a very high-level 
look at how the components of qmail interact with each other, check out <A 
href="http://www.nrg4u.com/">the qmail big picture</A>.)</P>
<P>My first advice to you will be: read all of the INSTALL files, and as many of 
the man files as you can. Learning how qmail's basic theories differ from those 
of sendmail's is a key requirement for understanding qmail. Try to get an idea 
of how qmail works.</P>
<P>Qmail breaks up each specific task of mail handling and assigns each to a 
different program. Each program is independent. This model has several 
advantages, including ease of use, faster debugging, and easy integration with 
custom tools.</P>
<H2><A name=ii>Requirements</A></H2>
<P>Before even attempting to install qmail, the following requirements must be 
met:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>You must be running UNIX or a UNIX-like operating system. A mostly 
  complete list of operating systems that qmail supports is contained in the 
  README file which is supplied with the qmail distribution. 
  <LI>You <B>MUST</B> have a working DNS, and your system must have a DNS name. 
  qmail does <B>not</B> search an /etc/hosts file in order to look up domain 
  names. A workaround is possible using /var/qmail/control/smtproutes, but doing 
  this is not recommended, or desirable in most cases. 
  <LI>You must have a working compiler (duh). If your compiler cannot be called 
  using "cc", you will have to edit the conf-* files in the qmail source tree in 
  order to tell qmail what to use. </LI></UL>
<H2><A name=iii>Our qmail installation</A></H2>
<P>qmail is extremely flexible. It is possible to install it in a zillion 
different ways. However, if you follow this HOWTO, exactly as it is written, you 
will wind up with a qmail installation that is surprisingly similar to most 
sendmail installations, including: 
<UL>
  <LI>Support for /etc/aliases 
  <LI>Support for .forward files </LI></UL>
<P>This HOWTO assumes that: 
<UL>
  <LI>You have at least a rudimentary knowledge of UNIX and how it works 
  <LI>You know how to add users, and set up init files on your particular 
  flavor/distribution 
  <LI>You are using GNU tar / gzip / binutils / gcc and other utilities. 
</LI></UL>
<H2><A name=1>1.</A> Downloading and unpacking the source.</H2>
<P>The first step in installing qmail is to download the necessary files from 
the server.</P>
<P>The packages you will need in order to follow this HOWTO are:</P><A 
href="http://cr.yp.to/qmail.html">qmail</A><BR><A 
href="http://www.flounder.net/qmail/qmail-dns-patch">oversize DNS packet patch 
for qmail</A><BR><A href="http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp.html">ucspi-tcp</A><BR><A 
href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html">daemontools</A><BR><A 
href="http://cr.yp.to/fastforward.html">fastforward</A><BR><A 
href="http://cr.yp.to/dot-forward.html">dot-forward</A><BR><BR>
<P>You will of course begin by unpacking your tarballs to an appropriate place 
(such as /usr/local/src/)</P>(We'll need to become root now.)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>root:/usr/local/src# gzip -d qmail-1.03.tar.gz
root:/usr/local/src# tar xf qmail-1.03.tar
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Then you need to change to the qmail-1.03 folder.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>root:/usr/local/src# cd qmail-1.03
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A name=2>2.</A> RTFM</H2>
<P>Once you are in the qmail folder you will want to start by reading the <B><A 
href="http://www.qmail.org/qmail-manual-html/misc/FAQ.html">FAQ</A></B> and 
INSTALL files.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>root:/usr/local/src/qmail-1.03# more INSTALL
root:/usr/local/src/qmail-1.03# more INSTALL.alias
root:/usr/local/src/qmail-1.03# more INSTALL.mbox
<I>etc...</I>
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>After you are done reading the INSTALL files, you won't need the rest of this 
HOWTO! <BR><BR>
<P>You're still reading. That means you didn't read the files. Bad sysadmin! Go 
sit in a corner for 15 minutes, or field helpdesk calls, or something equally 
annoying. 
<P>After you return, apply the oversize DNS packet patch. This patch is 
necessary because some providers (such as AOL) have decided to ignore the RFC's, 
and return UDP DNS responses that are greater than 512 bytes. qmail's DNS 
resolver library is strictly RFC compliant, and does not accept 
non-RFC-compliant replies. This patch enables qmail to correctly process illegal 
DNS replies. 
<P>To apply the patch, do the following (in the qmail source dir) 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>root:/usr/local/src/qmail-1.03# patch -p1 &lt; /path/to/qmail-103.patch
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A name=3>3.</A> Create the qmail home directory.</H2>
<P>The first thing we need to do on our road to qmail is to create the qmail 
home directory. This is the directory that almost all of qmail will reside in, 
including the configuration files, the queue, and the actual qmail binaries. 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE># mkdir /var/qmail
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A name=4>4.</A> Create the necessary users and groups to run qmail.</H2>
<P>Next, we need to create all of the users and groups that the various qmail 
daemons run as. See INSTALL.ids for these groups. If you run <A 
href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian Linux</A> then the users and groups are 
already created for you (how nice of Debian!). The following commands should 
work on most Linux distributions, and Solaris:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE># groupadd nofiles
# useradd -g nofiles -d /var/qmail/alias -s /bin/false alias
# useradd -g nofiles -d /var/qmail -s /bin/false qmaild
# useradd -g nofiles -d /var/qmail -s /bin/false qmaill
# useradd -g nofiles -d /var/qmail -s /bin/false qmailp
# groupadd qmail
# useradd -g qmail -d /var/qmail -s /bin/false qmailq
# useradd -g qmail -d /var/qmail -s /bin/false qmailr
# useradd -g qmail -d /var/qmail -s /bin/false qmails
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B>Note:</B> To obtain instructions for creating the qmail users on other 
operating systems, or if you are having problems with the commands above, read 
INSTALL.ids. 
<HR>

<CENTER>
<P><B>*** NOTE: IF YOU DO NOT CREATE THESE USERS AND GROUPS, QMAIL WILL NOT 
WORK. ***</B></P></CENTER>
<HR>

<H2><A name=5>5.</A> Compile qmail and related programs.</H2>
<P>The next step is to compile the programs and make the qmail directory tree. 
</P>Type:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>root:/usr/local/src/qmail-1.03# make setup check
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>qmail will then begin compiling. If you get a successful compile, then there 
will be a new directory tree under /var/qmail containing the complete qmail 
system.</P>
<P>Compiling the rest of the required programs is trivial on most systems. An 
example for rblsmtpd: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>root:/usr/local/src# tar zxvf daemontools-0.70.tar.gz
root:/usr/local/src# cd daemontools-0.70
root:/usr/local/src/daemontools-0.70# make setup check
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This will install daemontools to /usr/local/bin.</P>
<P>Do the same for ucspi-tcp, fastforward and dot-forward. If everything 
compiles and installs correctly, you should be done compiling. 
<H2><A name=6>6.</A> Configure qmail.</H2>
<P>After qmail compiles, we will want to configure it. The easiest way to do 
this is:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>root:/usr/local/src/qmail-1.03# ./config
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The config script tries to do a reverse DNS lookup on all local IP addresses. 
If this doesn't work, then you've got some dirty work to do. Read INSTALL.ctl. 
As long as all of your local IP's are in your DNS, then you shouldn't have any 
problems. Otherwise you can do the following:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>root:/usr/local/src/qmail-1.03# ./config-fast your.full.host.name
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This will create the necessary files in order to run qmail.</P>
<P>After running config or config-fast, you will probably need to update some of 
the files in /var/qmail/control in order to make your qmail system usable. See 
<A href="http://www.flounder.net/qmail/qmail-howto.html#14">Section 14: Control 
Files</A> for a description of some of the commonly used control files and what 
they do. 
<HR>
<B>Warning:</B> If the config scripts fail for some reason, do not attempt to 
continue this installation! If you start your qmail system without configuring 
it, it will not work properly, and you will also be running an open relay! 
<HR>

<H2><A name=7>7.</A> Install the qmail aliases.</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>root:/usr/local/src/qmail-1.03# cd ~alias
root:/var/qmail/alias# echo adam &gt; .qmail-root
root:/var/qmail/alias# echo bob &gt; .qmail-postmaster
root:/var/qmail/alias# echo bob &gt; .qmail-mailer-daemon
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Qmail uses files for every alias. This is one of the major ways that qmail 
differs from sendmail. This is explained in greater detail <A 
href="http://www.flounder.net/qmail/qmail-howto.html#13">below.</A> Note that 
there is an alias for root. This is because root does not receive mail in qmail. 
In fact, qmail-lspawn will immediately die and bounce the message if UID == 0. 
Read INSTALL.alias for more instructions.</P>
<H2><A name=8>8.</A> Set up daemontools and create control directories.</H2>
<P>Now that you've installed qmail, you'll need to set everything up so that 
qmail starts when your system comes up. In order to accomplish this, we're going 
to use <I>svscan</I>, which is part of the daemontools package. 
<P>If you've followed the HOWTO carefully so far, daemontools should already be 
installed in /usr/local/bin. 
<P>First, we'll need to create the daemontools services directory. Dan Bernstein 
recommends using /service for this directory. If you want to use a different 
directory, feel free. Just remember to replace /service with whatever directory 
you're using in the directions below. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE># mkdir /service
# mkdir /var/qmail/supervise
# mkdir /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-send
# chmod +t /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-send
# mkdir /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-send/log
# mkdir /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-smtpd
# chmod +t /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-smtpd
# mkdir /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-smtpd/log
# mkdir /var/log/qmail
# mkdir /var/log/qmail/qmail-send
# mkdir /var/log/qmail/qmail-smtpd
# chown qmaill /var/log/qmail
# chown qmaill /var/log/qmail/*
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Because of the way <I>svscan</I> works, we aren't going to actually create 
any directories under /service. Instead, we're going to create the <I>real</I> 
directories under /var/qmail/supervise. Later on, we'll make symlinks in 
/service to these directories, but not yet. 
<P>The next thing we need to do is make it so that <I>svscan</I> starts every 
time the system starts. On my system, I accomplish this with a simple rc script: 

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>#!/bin/sh -e
# /etc/init.d/svscan : start or stop svscan.
# borrowed from http://Web.InfoAve.Net/~dsill/lwq.html#start-qmail

case "$1" in
    start)
        echo -n "Starting djb services: svscan "
	cd /service
        env - PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH" svscan &amp;
        echo $! &gt; /var/run/svscan.pid
        echo "."
        ;;
    stop)
        echo -n "Stopping djb services: svscan "
        kill `cat /var/run/svscan.pid`
        echo -n "services "
        svc -dx /service/*
        echo -n " logging "
        svc -dx /service/*/log
        echo "."
        ;;
    restart|reload|force-reload)
        $0 stop
        $0 start
        ;;
    *)
        echo 'Usage: /etc/init.d/svscan {start|stop|restart}'
        exit 1
esac

exit 0
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you correctly add this script to init, <I>svscan</I> will start each time 
you boot your system. Please see the documentation for your particular system or 
distribution to find out how to add things to init. 
<P>If you are running <A href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</A>, you 
would issue the following command (assuming that your script is installed at 
/etc/init.d/svscan): 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE># update-rc.d svscan defaults
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In order to control qmail itself, another simple script can be used: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>#!/bin/sh -e
# /etc/init.d/qmail : start or stop the qmail mail subsystem.

        svc -u /var/qmail/supervise/*
        echo -n " qmail"
        svc -u /var/qmail/supervise/*/log
        echo " logging."
        ;;
    stop)
        echo -n "Stopping mail-transport-agent: "
        echo -n " qmail"
        svc -d /var/qmail/supervise/*
        echo " logging"
        svc -d /var/qmail/supervise/*/log
        ;;
    restart)
        $0 stop
        $0 start

        echo "Reloading 'locals' and 'virtualdomains' control files."
	svc -h /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-send
        ;;
    *)
        echo 'Usage: /etc/init.d/qmail {start|stop|restart|reload}'
        exit 1
esac

exit 0

<HR>
<B>Note:</B> Unlike the <I>svscan</I> script, this script does <B>NOT</B> need 
to be added to your init scripts. This script is for controlling qmail 
<I>after</I> it has been started via <I>svscan</I>. 
<HR>

<P>Now, it's time to create some stuff in /var/qmail/supervise. First, cd to 
/var/qmail/supervise/qmail-send. 
<P>Here, we need to create a script called <I>run</I> with the following 
contents: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>#!/bin/sh
exec /var/qmail/rc
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now, we need to create /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-send/log/run with the 
following contents: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/local/bin/setuidgid qmaill /usr/local/bin/multilog t s2500000 /var/log/qmail/qmail-send
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now, we will create similar files in /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-smtpd. For 
<I>run</I>, use the following: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>#!/bin/sh
QMAILDUID=`id -u qmaild`
NOFILESGID=`id -g qmaild`
exec /usr/local/bin/softlimit -m 2000000 \
 /usr/local/bin/tcpserver -H -R -v -p -x /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb \
 -u $QMAILDUID -g $NOFILESGID 0 smtp /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd 2&gt;&amp;1
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For <I>log/run</I>: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/local/bin/setuidgid qmaill /usr/local/bin/multilog t s2500000 /var/log/qmail/qmail-smtpd
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A name=8a>8a.</A> Access Control</H2>
<P>Before we can start up our qmail smtpd, we need to do some access control. 
The simplest way to do this is by using files in /etc. I use /etc/tcp.smtp as my 
access control file. If you don't need to do any access control, /etc/tcp.smtp 
can have just one line: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>:allow
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note that a default configuration does not allow for ANY relaying, even from 
localhost. To allow relaying from localhost and your local network, you would 
have to use something like this: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>127.0.0.1:allow,RELAYCLIENT=""
192.168.1.:allow,RELAYCLIENT=""
:allow
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For more examples, man tcprules.</P>
<P>After you've created your rules, you need to activate them. tcpserver works 
by reading a cdb (database) file. You use the tcprules program to build the

<H2><A name=9>9.</A> Kill sendmail!!</H2>
<P>If you've gotten this far, that means that you are ready to do away with 
rickety old sendmail for good. First, find the pid of your sendmail daemon and 
kill it!!! In Linux: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE># killall -TERM sendmail
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you don't feel that you've gained enough pleasure from this experience, 
then restart sendmail and kill it again. After that, do the following:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE># mv /usr/lib/sendmail /usr/lib/sendmail.old
# mv /usr/sbin/sendmail /usr/sbin/sendmail.old
# ln -s /var/qmail/bin/sendmail /usr/lib/sendmail
# ln -s /var/qmail/bin/sendmail /usr/sbin/sendmail

# mv /usr/sbin/newaliases /usr/sbin/newaliases.old
# ln -s /var/qmail/bin/newaliases /usr/sbin/newaliases
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
Note: /usr/sbin may not exist on your system. </HR>
<HR>
<B>*** IMPORTANT:</B> Keep in mind that sendmail is most likely being started in 
your init scripts. You will need to remove sendmail from your init scripts so 
that it does not start again when the system is rebooted. You will need to 
consult the documentation for your particular operating system in order to do 
this. 
<HR>

<H2><A name=10>10.</A> Create /var/qmail/rc.</H2>
<P>/var/qmail/rc is one of the most important qmail files. It is responsible for 
starting qmail, but more importantly, it tells qmail what to do with every email 
it receives. <I>rc</I> contains the <I>default delivery instructions</I> for 
qmail. 
<P>We want our system to support .forward files, and deliver mail to 
/var/spool/mail. Therefore, we need a /var/qmail/rc file that looks something 
like this: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>#!/bin/sh

exec env - PATH="/var/qmail/bin:$PATH" \
qmail-start '|dot-forward .forward
|preline procmail'
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A name=10a>10a.</A> Maildir.</H2>
<P>Maildir is an alternate way of delivering messages. Maildirs have the 
following benefits:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Lock-free -- This means Maildirs are reliable over NFS. 
  <LI>Enables use of qmail-pop3d, a secure POP3 daemon which comes with qmail. 
  <LI>Programs don't have to stat() /var/spool/mail every time they open your 
  mailbox. On systems with a large userbase, this can make things excruciatingly 
  slow. 
  <LI>Supported natively by the <A href="http://www.mutt.org/">mutt MUA</A>. 
  </LI></UL>There are also some disadvantages to using Maildirs. 
<UL>
  <LI>Some popular mail programs, such as PINE, need to be patched and 
  recompiled in order to use Maildirs. You will need the <A 
  href="http://www.flounder.net/qmail/">Bloodhounds International c-client 
  Maildir patch</A> in order to patch Pine. 
  <LI>Maildirs store each message in its own separate file. This consumes more 
  inodes than keeping mail in one spool file. </LI></UL>
<P>If you want to deliver to Maildirs in users' home directories instead of 
/var/spool/mail, you can change /var/qmail/rc to look something like this: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>#!/bin/sh

exec env - PATH="/var/qmail/bin:$PATH" \
qmail-start '|dot-forward .forward
./Maildir/'
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Remember, the Maildir must be owned by the user it belongs to. If you create 
maildirs as root, then you will have to use the <I>chown</I> command in order to 
change the ownership. A good idea is to include a Maildir in /etc/skel, so that 
the Maildir will be automatically created whenever you make a new user. To learn 
more about Maildirs, read INSTALL.maildir. </P>
<H2><A name=11>11.</A> Starting qmail.</H2>
<P>Everything is in place now, and we are ready to start qmail. Since svscan is 
already running, all we need to do is create symlinks in /service to our control 
directories in /var/qmail/supervise. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE># ln -s /var/qmail/supervise/* /service/
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>qmail services should start within one minute. To check if the services have 
started, you can run <I>ps</I>. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE># ps auxww | grep qmail
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You should see several tasks running, at the very least qmail-send, and some 
supervise processes. If these processes don't show up within a minute, you've 
probably done something wrong, and you should go back and retrace your steps. 
<P>Once the qmail processes show up, you can test local deliveries by following 
the instructions in TEST.deliver. You can check to make sure your qmail-smtpd is 
listening by telneting to port 25 of the local machine. 
<H2><A name=12>12.</A> rblsmtpd.</H2>
<P>rblsmtpd is a generic program that is part of ucspi-tcp and works with any 
SMTP server that can run under tcpserver (for example, qmail and sendmail.) If 
you only want to block sites that are listed in the <A 
href="http://maps.vix.com/rbl">MAPS RBL</A>, then you do not need to give 
rblsmtpd any arguments except the name of the SMTP daemon to run. However, if 
you want to block based on other blocking systems, such as <A 
href="http://relays.mail-abuse.org/">Relay Spam Stopper (RSS)</A>, you will need 
to run multiple instances of rblsmtpd, using the -b flag with the name of the 
server that you want each invocation to perform lookups at.</P>
<P>In order to add rblsmtpd to your qmail installation, you must make some 
changes to the <I>run</I> script in /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-smtpd: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>#!/bin/sh
QMAILDUID=`id -u qmaild`
NOFILESGID=`id -g qmaild`
exec /usr/local/bin/softlimit -m 2000000 \
 /usr/local/bin/tcpserver -H -R -v -p -x /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb \
 -u $QMAILDUID -g $NOFILESGID 0 smtp rblsmtpd /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd 2&gt;&amp;1
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you have a good eye, you can see that we've added an <I>rblsmtpd</I> 
before the qmail-smtpd process. This will block mail which is listed in the 
rbl.maps.vix.com zone. If we wanted to also use the RSS, we would add another 
rblsmtpd before qmail-smtpd, ie: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>#!/bin/sh
QMAILDUID=`id -u qmaild`
NOFILESGID=`id -g qmaild`
exec /usr/local/bin/softlimit -m 2000000 \
 /usr/local/bin/tcpserver -H -R -v -p -x /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb \
 -u $QMAILDUID -g $NOFILESGID 0 smtp rblsmtpd rblsmtpd -rrelays.mail-abuse.org /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd 2&gt;&amp;1
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can add as many rblsmtpd processes as you want to check multiple 
blacklists. 
<H2><A name=13>13.</A> RTFM</H2>
<P>At this time, it would be a good idea to read some of the official 
documentation. Of course, you're not going to do that, you're going to continue 
reading my drivel. I have an almost obscene power over you now. It intoxicates 
me.</P>
<P>Anyway, back to qmail.</P>
<H2><A name=14>14.</A> The control files.</H2>
<P>Once you've got your qmail system set up and running, there are a few things 
you're going to have to learn how to do. First of all, you'll be happy to know, 
that virtual hosts are *WAY* easier to do in qmail than they are in sendmail. 
<P>Look in your /var/qmail/control directory. Most likely, it'll look something 
like this:

<P>The three most important files here (in order of importance) 
are:</P><I>me</I> -- (in fact qmail can survive with JUST this file. It contains 
your local host name. <I>Including domain</I>)<BR><I>rcpthosts</I> -- (All of 
the hosts that qmail will receive mail for. All of your local domains must be in 
this file.)<BR>
<HR>
<B>Important: qmail bounces mail for domains not listed in rcpthosts. All of 
your domains, including virtual domains, <I>must</I> be listed in this file. In 
addition, not having an rcpthosts file turns your qmail server into an open 
relay. Running an open relay on the internet is not acceptable, and if you do, 
you will soon be listed by the various open-relay blacklists such as ORBS and 
RSS.</B>
<HR>
 <I>locals</I> -- (All of the hosts that are <I>local</I>. I.E. mail sent to 
these hosts will be delivered to users in /etc/passwd.)<BR>
<H2><A name=15>15.</A> <A 
href="http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/dot-qmail.html">dot-qmail</A>.</H2>
<P>dot-qmail is an important concept and I think it deserves its own section, 
even though this document is a HOWTO. This is because you will use dot-qmail for 
95% of what you will do with qmail once it's installed.</P>
<P>dot-qmail is what tells qmail-local what to do with a message once it is 
received. With dot-qmail, a user can forward her mail, create ezmlm mailing 
lists (such as <A href="mailto:qmail-help@list.cr.yp.to">the qmail mailing 
list</A>), create aliases under her own username, and call external programs 
such as autoresponders.</P>
<P>dot-qmail exists in the form of .qmail files in a user's home directory. <A 
href="http://www.qmail.org/man/man8/qmail-local.html">qmail-local</A> reads 
these files in order to decide what to do with a message.</P>
<P>When qmail does not find a .qmail file, it follows the default delivery 
instructions in /var/qmail/rc (or whatever script you are running qmail-start 
from). Please see the <A href="http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/dot-qmail.html">man 
page for dot-qmail</A> for a listing of the commands available.</P>
<P>The great thing about dot-qmail is that it lets users set up their own 
aliases. If my user account is named "adam", then I can set up a file called 
.qmail-info, which will contain commands for processing messages addressed to 
adam-info. dot-qmail can be used to create as many aliases as you'd like, and 
can even be used for distribution lists.</P>
<H2><A name=16>16.</A> Virtual domains.</H2>
<P>Thanks to dot-qmail, virtual domains are as easy as normal aliases to create. 
The file <I>virtualdomains</I> uses the following format:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>example.com:user
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Where <I>user</I> is the username of the user that receives mail for this 
domain. This seems complicated at first, but it is actually very intuitive.</P>
<P>If my user account <I>adam</I> is specified by <I>virtualdomains</I> to 
receive mail for example.com, then any .qmail files I create in my home 
directory will work as aliases for example.com, as well as their normal usage. 
So, .qmail-info becomes info@example.com.</P>
<P><I>But what if I want to manage more than one virtual domain from my user 
account?</I></P><BR>The <I>virtualdomains</I> file makes this very intuitive as 
well. Instead of putting <I>user</I> as the recipient, just put <I>user-ext</I> 
as the recipient. For example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>example.com:adam-example
example2.com:adam-example2
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>With this configuration, creating virtual host aliases is just as easy, the 
only difference is that we add an extension to the dot-qmail filename. Now, 
info@example.com becomes .qmail-example-info, and info@example2.com becomes 
.qmail-example2-info, etc.</P>
<P>If .qmail-ext doesn't exist, qmail-local will try some default .qmail files. 
For example, if ext is foo-bar, qmail-local will try first .qmail-foo-bar, then 
.qmail-foo- default, and finally .qmail-default. If none of these exist, 
qmail-local will bounce the message. (Exception: for the basic user address, 
qmail-local treats a nonexistent .qmail the same as an empty .qmail.) <I>This 
paragraph was taken directly from the dot-qmail man page.</I></P>
<H2><A name=17>17.</A> Fastforward.</H2>
<P>Most sendmail users will be familiar with /etc/aliases. djb's 
<I>fastforward</I> package supports everything sendmail supports in 
/etc/aliases, plus more. 
<P>To activate /etc/aliases, put the following in 
/var/qmail/alias/.qmail-default: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>| fastforward -d /etc/aliases.cdb
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Congratulations, /etc/aliases is now active. You may add sendmail style 
aliases to /etc/aliases, along with virtual domain aliases (which sendmail 
doesn't support). Be sure to run /var/qmail/bin/newaliases after making any 
changes to /etc/aliases. Read the file ALIASES in your fastforward source 
distribution for more detailed information. 
<H2><A name=18>18.</A> The End.</H2>
<P>qmail is an extremely fast, flexible, and secure MTA. There are many other 
applications for it, and I have not even begun to scratch the surface of what 
you can do with it. For more information, read the <A
